PRs will be reviewed (and hopefully accepted) as soon as possible. The only stipulation is that they cannot modify the app in ways that would make it completely deviate from its original purpose. No paid API usage, no data hosted in external servers, no calls home, no huge UI changes that completely change the look and feel of the app. Essentially, I want the app to still feel like something I made, and I absolutely want privacy and freeware to be at the forefront of the project's mission.
